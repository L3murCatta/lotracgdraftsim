# lotracgdraftsim
A simple script to simulate LotR ACG Draft experience.

# Installation
You need Python 3 (3.6.4 or later should do perfectly fine) to launch the script.
After installing Python (and rebooting your computer to ensure your PATH is updated) run CMD and type "pip install pyperclip" (it's a small Python library required for a certain feature in the code).
When it's done, you can either double-click the .py file, type "python lotrdraft.py" in CMD from the directory where the file is located, or open IDLE (standard Python IDE), open the .py file and press F5.

# Process
is pretty straightforward. You won't see cards that your heroes do not allow to use (e.g. out of sphere or high level requirement). All cards are included in the shuffle, so if you don't own some of them yet, don't select them.
For best experience, build deck in your game client as you go. When you're done, your deck will be automatically copied to your clipboard so you can share it with your friends or with us at https://discord.gg/XDdRVzs
